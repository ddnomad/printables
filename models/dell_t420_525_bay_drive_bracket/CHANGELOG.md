Changelog
========

v0.1.2
------

Even more improved version as tolerances in v0.1.1 turned out to be either a bit too tight (bracket width) or too loose (drive mounting walls). This version was test printed multiple times and is fully ready to be used as intended.

### Fixes

* Reduced spacing between drive mounting walls by 1mm.
* Decreased bracket width by 1mm (v0.1.1 is technically a perfect fit but it is quite tricky to get the bracket installed / removed from the bay)

v0.1.1
------

Improved version with better tolerances and less filament required for printing.

### Fixes

* Increased spacing between drive mounting walls by 2mm.
* Pushed bottom plate cutouts 1mm further into the back.
* Reduced cutouts width by 1mm.
* Increased bracket width by 2mm.
* Increased diameter of drive mounting screw holes by 0.5mm.
* Increased vertical spacing between drives by 1mm.

### Improvements

* Significantly reduced amount of filament required to print the model.
* Reduced printing time down to around 3 hours (v0.1.0 required ~6 hours to print with a raft, which used to be necessary).

### Other

* Simplified the model source code.
* Switched to a different indentation style for shorter code blocks.

v0.1.0
------

Initial version that won't be published anywhere. Does the job but has some minor tolerances issues and requires too much filament to print (comparing to a "theoretical" minimum).
